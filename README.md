# custom-guix-installer

This repository automatically generates custom installation images for the GNU Guix system. It is based on a similar project [here](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/guix-installer) and adds some additional configurations and packages and ~~fixes an annoyance during installation in the mentioned project as described in [this issue report](https://github.com/SystemCrafters/guix-installer/issues/7)~~ that part doesn't seem to work yet.

It should be noted that this image contains the nonfree vanilla Linux kernel, so be warned if that's a problem for you.


You can take a look at the repo mentioned above for more information on how this works.


Thanks for reading!
